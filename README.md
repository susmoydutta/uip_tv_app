A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Project Title: TV & Movie Streaming App with Short Films

Description: This app provides a seamless and interactive platform for streaming TV shows, movies, and short films. Developed using Flutter, GetX for state management, and Hive for local storage, the app delivers an optimized and smooth experience for users.

Key Features:

Content Categories: Explore a variety of entertainment options including trending movies, popular TV shows, and handpicked short films. The app offers personalized recommendations to ensure users find the content they love.

Seamless Streaming: With a clean, intuitive UI, users can easily navigate through the app to watch their favorite content. The app ensures quick loading times and smooth playback, offering high-quality streaming.

GetX for State Management: GetX is used to efficiently manage the state across the app. This ensures that the app remains responsive and performs well, even when handling dynamic data such as user profiles, movie lists, and preferences.

REST API Integration: The app pulls real-time data from a REST API to fetch the latest TV shows, movies, and short films. This allows users to stay updated with new content and ensure they always have access to the most recent releases.

Hive for Local Storage: Hive is used to store user data, such as profiles, preferences, and offline movie lists, ensuring that the app performs efficiently even when there is no internet connection. It also helps in caching data like trending movies, allowing for quick access to content without needing to fetch data every time.

User Profile Management: The app supports user personalization by storing and displaying their profile, viewing history, and preferences. It also features a dynamic welcome message based on the user's name and image.

Offline Support: Users can enjoy watching movies and TV shows even without an internet connection, thanks to Hive's local storage support. The app caches the most viewed and recently watched content for offline use.

Refresh & Update: The app supports refreshing content with a pull-to-refresh mechanism, allowing users to get the latest content or updates from the server without leaving the screen.

This app is perfect for anyone looking for a one-stop solution to watch TV shows, movies, and short films on the go, with an enhanced user experience powered by GetX, REST API, and Hive local database.
